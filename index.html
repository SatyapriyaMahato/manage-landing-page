  What’s different about Manage?

  Manage provides all the functionality your team needs, without
  the complexity. Our software is tailor-made for modern digital

  tracking progress at the milestone level all the way done to the
  smallest of details. Never lose sight of the bigger picture again.

  02
  Advanced built-in reports
  Set internal delivery estimates and track progress toward company
  goals. Our customisable dashboard helps you build out the reports
  you need to keep key stakeholders informed.

  03
  Everything you need in one place
  Stop jumping from one service to another to communicate, store files,
  track tasks and share documents. Manage offers an all-in-one team
  productivity solution.
